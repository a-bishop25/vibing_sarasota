Vibing Sarasota

Vibing Sarasota is a web application built to help people discover fun, local spots around Sarasota, Florida. The goal is simple: make it easier for users to find things to do—whether that’s grabbing food, playing a round of golf, planning a family outing, or just exploring something new—without digging through endless search results or outdated lists.

This project is still a work in progress. The frontend is largely functional, and the backend is partially implemented, with a focus so far on user authentication and interaction tracking. The long-term vision is a clean, location-based discovery platform that feels personal, lightweight, and easy to use.

Project Purpose

Sarasota has no shortage of things to do, but finding the right spot often depends on what you’re in the mood for. Vibing Sarasota is designed to organize local places into intuitive categories—dining, golf, family activities, and more—while allowing users to save favorites and build their own curated experience.

Rather than trying to be a full-scale review platform, the emphasis is on discovery and personalization.

Current Features

At its current stage, the project includes:

A functional frontend website structure

Category-based browsing for local activities and locations

MongoDB integration to support backend functionality

Early-stage user authentication setup

User tracking that records when a user updates their favorites list

Persistent storage of user interactions related to favorites

Some backend routes and logic are still incomplete, and not all pages are fully wired into the database yet. That said, the core data flow for users and favorites is in place and working.

Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: JavaScript (Node.js–based structure)

Database: MongoDB

Authentication: MongoDB-backed user records (initial implementation)

The project is structured to allow further expansion of backend logic as features are added.

Project Status

This repository represents an active development build. The frontend framework is established, and backend development is ongoing. Some functionality is intentionally incomplete as the project is being built incrementally rather than all at once.

Future development will focus on:

Completing backend routes for all categories

Improving authentication flow and session handling

Expanding user personalization features

Cleaning up data validation and error handling

Refining UI/UX consistency across pages

Why This Project Exists

This project was built as both a practical application and a learning exercise. It explores full-stack web development concepts, database integration, and user-based interaction tracking, while also serving a real-world use case tied to a specific local community.

It’s meant to grow over time, not be “finished” all at once.
